Using TDD, I created a REST API for managing companies and stores, allowing the registration and listing of companies and the creation, updating, retrieval, and deletion of stores. The solution includes two projects, one exclusively for tests and another exclusively for the API. I should also mention that I used EF Core with a code-first approach in this solution.

Used .NET 8.
